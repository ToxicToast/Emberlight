# 🔥 Emberlight

**Emberlight** is a dark, text-based RPG built for the browser, inspired by *Legend of the Green Dragon*. You play as a **Runebearer**, awoken in a dying world covered in ash, where forgotten gods whisper and memories hold power.

> *"In a world of silence, only the ember remembers."*
